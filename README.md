This is an educational app. 
Since the beginning of the pandemic, students started attending online classes. Most of them were old enough to handle their own devices and online presence.
However, young students, mostly below the age of 12-15, may not have their own devices, especially those living in rural areas. They use their parents' devices and online profiles.
But those parents are not always aware of how things work in this era of virtual world. 

This app is created to help these people understand the basics and necessary concept to help them guide themeselves throughout the virtual world.
